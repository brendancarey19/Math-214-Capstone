# Math-214-Capstone
All the code that I wrote for the Math 214 capstone project, exploring the properties of expander graphs to the application of error correcting codes.

The .cpp file contains the decoding algorithm, with an input file of a bipartite graph adjacency matrix. 

The .m file contains the script I wrote to calculate the eigenvaules of the graphs' adjancency matrices.  

All code is my own. The algorithm implemented in decoder.cpp is based off of a procedural outline detailed in a paper by tim Roughgarden and Gregory Valiant, which can be found a this link: http://timroughgarden.org/s17/l/l19.pdf
